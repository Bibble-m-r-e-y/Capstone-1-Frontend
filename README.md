## Getting Started

This app works best in conjunction with a Capstone I Backend. Go to that repo and get it up and running so that this Frontend has an API to request data from.

With that done, run the following commands:

1. Clone or fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Install the NPM packages: `npm install`
3. Preview your React app: `npm run start-dev`

You should be able to deploy this application to Vercel by simply connecting the GitHub repo to a new Vercel project. You will also need to configure the `API_URL` environment variable on Vercel to match the deployed API url for your backend. Likewise, you may need to configure the `FRONTEND_URL` environment varialbe on your Backend to match the deployed URL for this app.
